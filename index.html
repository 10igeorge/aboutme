            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome! My name is Isabelle and I am a Junior Developer currently enrolled in Epicodus in Portland, Oregon.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated from St. Edwards University in Austin, Texas where I spent most of my life. Stuck with a degree that I loved, but knew I would never use, I aimlessly worked various jobs since completing college. I worked a short time in retail, ages in the restaurant industry, and finally with a non-profit before I arrived at Epicodus.
            </p>
            <p>
              My only experience with code and programming lies with my awkward, nerdy, 14-year-old self. I was obsessed with video games and created new servers from a couple computer games I was playing. Of course, I didn't build this code myself, I went inside the existing code and tinkered with what already existed. Later, I went on to take a C++ class in high school, but for some reason my interest fizzled out in college.
            </p>
            <p>
              That brings us to today! With no ideas for a career path, I remembered how much I had actually enjoyed sitting in front of code for hours and making something functional. The next hurdle will be to find the language that suits me best. I enjoy both design and the back-end aspects of programming, so I have a pretty big pool of options!
